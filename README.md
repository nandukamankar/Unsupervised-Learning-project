Unsupervised ML-Online_Retail_Customer_Segmentation - Nandu Kamankar.ipynb
Overview
This project aims to analyze a transnational dataset from a UK-based non-store online retail company specializing in unique all-occasion gifts. The primary objective is to identify major customer segments within the dataset using various analytical techniques and machine learning algorithms. Customer segmentation allows the company to tailor marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer service to meet the specific needs and preferences of each segment.

Project Steps
Initial Exploration:

Conducted simple binning and quantile-based segmentation to gain an initial understanding of the data.
Implemented a basic segmentation model for a preliminary overview of customer behavior.
K-Means Clustering:

Applied k-means clustering to group customers based on similarities in purchasing behavior.
Visualized results with different numbers of clusters.
Acknowledged the limitations of k-means and explored alternative clustering methods.
Alternative Clustering Techniques:

Utilized Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN clusterer to identify different patterns in the data.
Compared and contrasted results with those obtained from k-means clustering.
Creation of Useful Clusters:

Developed several customer clusters based on various metrics to categorize customers according to their behavioral attributes.
Considered factors such as valuability, loyalty, and profitability in defining the clusters.
Segmentation Summary:

Recognized that the choice of segments depends on how the business intends to use the results and the desired level of granularity.
Presented major customer segments in a summary dataframe, highlighting key characteristics and metrics for each segment.
Conclusion
While visibly distinct clusters may not be evident in the plots, the clusters obtained through various algorithms and statistical analyses are deemed valid and useful for business insights. The project emphasizes the importance of starting with simpler models for a preliminary understanding before progressing to more complex algorithms. The identified segments offer valuable information for targeted marketing campaigns, improved customer satisfaction, and increased profitability.

Usage and Recommendations
Interpretation of Results:

Understand that clusters represent groups of customers with similar characteristics or behaviors.
Consider the identified segments as a starting point for tailoring marketing strategies and business decisions.
Customization of Segments:

Customize segments based on the specific needs and goals of the business.
Adjust segmentation criteria to align with the business's marketing and operational strategies.
Continuous Improvement:

Regularly update and refine segmentation models based on new data and evolving business objectives.
Consider additional data sources to enhance the accuracy and relevance of customer segments.
Actionable Insights:

Use the insights gained from customer segmentation to drive targeted marketing campaigns, enhance customer engagement, and improve overall business performance.
